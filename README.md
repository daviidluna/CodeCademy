# About this README:
- This will include projects that I go over in Codecademy classes.

# Project 1: Block Letters 

# Project 2: Receipts for Lovely Loveseats
* In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

# Project 3: Sal's Shipping
